# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the 
[swagger-spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled JAX-RS server.

This example uses the [JAX-RS](https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/) framework.

To generate sources from swagger spec
```
mvn -P build clean generate-sources
```

To run the server, please execute the following:
```
mvn -P dev clean jetty:run
```

To format code
```
mvn clean formatter:format
```

### Install dependencies without running tests 
```
mvn -P no-test clean install
```
